# Job Matching Engine

AI-powered job matching engine using NLP-based candidate-role similarity, embedding models, and machine learning ranking techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to automate and enhance the process of matching candidates to job roles using data-driven techniques. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful representations from job descriptions and candidate profiles, enabling accurate similarity scoring and ranking.

## Features

* Text preprocessing and normalization (resumes, job descriptions)
* Embedding-based similarity (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Transformer embeddings such as BERT)
* Cosine similarity for candidate-role scoring
* Machine learning ranking models for improved recommendations
* Scalable pipeline for batch evaluation

## Approach and Models

| Step               | Method                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text Processing    | Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization                 |
| Embedding Models   | TF-IDF / Word2Vec / BERT (Sentence Transformers)              |
| Similarity Scoring | Cosine Similarity / Semantic Distance                         |
| Ranking Strategy   | Rule-Based + ML Ranking (e.g., XGBoost / Logistic Regression) |
