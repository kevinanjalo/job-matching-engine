# Job Matching Engine

AI-powered job matching engine using NLP-based candidate-role similarity, embedding models, and machine learning ranking techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to automate and enhance the process of matching candidates to job roles using data-driven techniques. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful representations from job descriptions and candidate profiles, enabling accurate similarity scoring and ranking.

## Features

* Text preprocessing and normalization (resumes, job descriptions)
* Embedding-based similarity (SBERT)
* Cosine similarity for candidate-role scoring
* Machine learning ranking models for improved recommendations
* Scalable pipeline for batch evaluation
